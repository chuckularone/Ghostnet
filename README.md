This is a repository for the Ghostnet manual. I will do my best to update "Release Notes" for each version. There is, however a big disclaimer. I AM NOT THE AUTHOR. I would like some help with the release notes. If you see anything that I missed from version to version, please assist in updating the notes.

Thanks,

-Chuck
